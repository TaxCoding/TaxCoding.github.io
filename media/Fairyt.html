            <p><span class="yellow">Once</span> upon a time, <span class="orange">there</span> <span class="yellow">was</span> a <span class="orange">young princess</span> who <span class="yellow">lived</span> in a <span class="orange">grand castle</span>. <span class="orange">She</span> <span class="yellow">was</span> known for her <span class="orange">kindness</span> and <span class="orange">beauty</span>, and <span class="orange">everyone</span> in the <span class="orange">kingdom</span> <span class="yellow">loved</span> her. <span class="brown">One day</span>, while <span class="orange">she</span> <span class="yellow">was walking</span> through the <span class="orange">enchanted forest</span>, <span class="orange">she</span> <span class="yellow">lost</span> her <span class="orange">way</span>.</p>

            <p><span class="purple">As</span> the <span class="orange">sun</span> <span class="yellow">began</span> to <span class="yellow">set</span>, <span class="orange">she</span> <span class="yellow">met</span> an <span class="orange">old woman</span>. The <span class="orange">old woman</span> <span class="green">said</span> kindly, <span class="red">"You seem lost, dear child. Where are you headed?"</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="green">replied</span>, <span class="red">"I am trying to find my way back to the castle, but I don't know which path to take."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">old woman</span> <span class="yellow">pointed</span> to a <span class="orange">narrow path</span> and <span class="green">advised</span> the <span class="orange">princess</span>, <span class="red">"Follow this path, but be careful. It is filled with dangers."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">thanked</span> her and <span class="green">said</span>, <span class="red">"I will follow your advice. Thank you for helping me."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">old woman</span> <span class="green">warned</span> her again, <span class="red">"Remember, child, not everything is what it seems."</span></p>

            <p>Later, the <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">told</span> herself that <span class="brown">she</span> must be brave. She <span class="blue">thought</span>, <span class="red">"I must find my way home, no matter what happens."</span></p>

            <p><span class="purple">As</span> <span class="orange">she</span> <span class="yellow">walked cautiously</span> along the <span class="orange">path</span>, <span class="orange">she</span> <span class="yellow">heard</span> a <span class="orange">voice</span> whispering from the <span class="orange">trees</span>, <span class="red">"Turn back now, or you will never return."</span></p>

            <p>Frightened but determined, the <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">continued</span> <span class="yellow">walking</span>, ignoring the <span class="orange">voices</span>. She <span class="blue">thought</span>, <span class="red">"These voices are only trying to scare me."</span> Soon, she <span class="yellow">encountered</span> a <span class="orange">talking fox</span>. The <span class="orange">fox</span> <span class="green">asked</span>, <span class="red">"Why are you walking alone in this dangerous forest?"</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">explained</span> that <span class="brown">she</span> <span class="yellow">was trying</span> to return to the <span class="orange">castle</span> but had lost her <span class="orange">way</span>. She <span class="green">said</span>, <span class="red">"I am lost, and I donâ€™t know which way leads home."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">fox</span> <span class="green">replied</span>, <span class="red">"The path ahead is full of traps, but I can guide you if you trust me."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">nodded</span> and <span class="green">said</span>, <span class="red">"I trust you. Please, lead the way."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">fox</span> <span class="green">offered</span> to <span class="yellow">guide</span> her and <span class="green">added</span>, <span class="red">"But you must follow closely. The forest is full of magic and tricks."</span></p>

            <p><span class="purple">When</span> they finally <span class="yellow">arrived</span> at the <span class="orange">castle</span>, the <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">thanked</span> the <span class="orange">fox</span> and <span class="yellow">promised</span>, <span class="red">"I will never forget your kindness, and I will tell my father of your great help."</span></p>

            <p><span class="purple">Later</span>, <span class="brown">when</span> the <span class="orange">king</span> <span class="yellow">saw</span> his <span class="orange">daughter</span> safe, he <span class="green">said</span> with relief, <span class="red">"I am so glad you are home."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">princess</span> <span class="yellow">told</span> him everything that had <span class="yellow">happened</span>. She <span class="green">explained</span>, <span class="red">"I met a kind old woman and a talking fox who guided me through the dangerous forest."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">king</span> <span class="yellow">praised</span> the <span class="orange">fox</span> for his <span class="orange">help</span> and <span class="green">said</span>, <span class="red">"You will always be welcome in our kingdom."</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="orange">fox</span> <span class="green">replied</span> modestly, <span class="red">"I am happy to help, Your Majesty."</span></p>
